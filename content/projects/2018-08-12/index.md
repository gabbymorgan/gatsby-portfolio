# Description

Web application that connects employers to job-seekers using a skill-based search engine and a like/match/message user interface. Recruiters can post a job and receive a list of candidates who are skill-matched to the posting. Candidates can fill out a single form and receive a list of jobs that are relevant to their skill set. When both parties like each other, a match is made, and they can reach out via the in-app messaging system.
